2) Install the headers and libraries to your system.

   * Build from the source as recommended from the docs/*/install.txt files, "*" based on your environment.

3) In the main FluoRender directory, (containing "CMakeLists.txt" & "fluorender" folder):

   * Type "ccmake ." to configure build properties.

4) If all properties are set as desired, type "cmake ." in the terminal. 

5) If cmake generated Makefiles successfully, type "make" .

Using cmake, you can generate XCode (MacOS X). Simply type "cmake" to find the proper options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download the latest wxWidgets (currently 3.0.0).

2) Install the headers and libraries to your system.

    - Download and install using the installer. 

    - Compile using Visual Studio (C:/wxWidgets-3.0.0/build/msw/wx_vc7.sln)

2) You will need to add lines to C:/Program Files (x86)/CMake X.X/chare/cmake-x.x/Modules (x's are your version) 
    for wxWidgets 3.0.

   - Starting about line 277, you will have listed a few sets of library versions to 
     search for like "wxbase29${_UCD}${_DBG}"

   - In 4 places, you will need to add above each line with a "29" a new line that is exactly the same, but with a "30" instead.

3) In the main FluoRender directory, (containing "CMakeLists.txt" & "fluorender" folder):

       * Use the C:\Program Files(x86)\CMake2.8\bin\cmake-gui.exe in the CMake install folder to configure build properties.

           - Choose the FluoRender main folder for both browse options (source and build)

           - Edit the values as necessary, Click Configure, then Click Generate.
              Be sure to set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to C:/wxWidgets-3.0.0/lib/vc_lib 
              Be sure to set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to C:/wxWidgets-3.0.0 

      * If all properties are set as desired, type "cmake ." in the terminal. 

      * Open the Visual Studio SLN file generated by CMake.

      * Build the solution.
