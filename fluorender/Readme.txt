To build FluoRender:
13 March 2014

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OSX/Linux Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download and install "Homebrew", found at "http://brew.sh"

2) Install WxWidgets using Homebrew.
  
   * Type "brew install wxwidgets"

   * You may need root pivileges to link the libraries if brew asks you to.

3) In the main FluoRender directory, (containing "CMakeLists.txt" & "fluorender" folder):

   * Type "ccmake ." to configure build properties.

4) If all properties are set as desired, type "cmake ." in the terminal. 

5) If cmake generated Makefiles successfully, type "make" .

Using cmake, you can generate XCode (MacOS X). Simply type "cmake" to find the proper options.

   * Type "cmake -G Xcode"

   * You may need to clear old cmake files. Type "./clear.sh" to remove unneccessary files. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download the latest wxWidgets (currently 3.0.0).

2) Install the headers and libraries to your system.

    * Download and install using the installer. 

    * Compile using Visual Studio (C:/wxWidgets-3.0.0/build/msw/wx_vc7.sln)

    * Be sure to compile the same configuration (Debug/Release) as you do for FluoRender below.

2) You will need to add lines to C:/Program Files (x86)/CMake X.X/share/cmake-x.x/Modules (x's are your version) 
    for wxWidgets 3.0.

    * Starting about line 277, you will have listed a few sets of library versions to 
     search for like "wxbase29${_UCD}${_DBG}"

    * In 4 places, you will need to add above each line with a "29" a new line that is exactly the same, but with a "30" instead.

3) In the main FluoRender directory, (containing "CMakeLists.txt" & "fluorender" folder):

    * Use the C:\Program Files(x86)\CMake2.8\bin\cmake-gui.exe in the CMake install folder to configure build properties.

         - Choose the FluoRender main folder for both browse options (source and build)

         - Edit the values as necessary, Click Configure, then Click Generate.
              Be sure to set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to C:/wxWidgets-3.0.0/lib/vc_lib (assuming these are your wxWidget dirs)
              Be sure to set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to C:/wxWidgets-3.0.0 (assuming these are your wxWidget dirs)

    * If all properties are set as desired, type "cmake ." in the terminal. 

    * Open the Visual Studio SLN file generated by CMake.

    * Build the solution.

    * You may need to right-click FluoRender project on the left to "Set as StarUp Project" for it to run.

    * You may also need to add additional dependencies in the FluoRender properties
