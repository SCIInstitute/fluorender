1) The first challenge I faced was how to read integer, float arrays from java to C++. the code was working for integer, float variables.
Solution: The solution is, since integer arrays in Java are java objects, call the method with return type object. Hence instead of using CallStaticIntMethod use CallStaticObjectMethod.
